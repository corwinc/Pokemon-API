On a scale of 1 to 10, how well rested and mentally ready were you when you began your work today?
6/7 -- despite trying, I slept pretty poorly last night. I guess nerves! Otherwise, I felt pretty good about the concepets, particularly b/c the mvp was a huge help in prep.

How do you feel about your work on the summary assessment today?
Generally I feel good about the direction it was going in and the confidence that I could make it work eventually.
I spent a *lot* of time stuck on the fact that I couldn't get the server to serve up my static files. I wasn't able to test my front-end because of it. I did the best I could drafting the code without being able to de-bug it.

What aspect of your work today are you most proud of?
DB queries worked with very few corrections.

Did you experience any extenuating circumstances that impeded your work? (e.g., my computer froze and it took me an hour to fix)
Nothing more than getting caught w/ static file serving

Are you uncertain how well you did on the prompt?
Uncertain b/c little debugging on front-end but generaly feel pretty good about the direction / knowing mostly what had to be done
Re-worked routing in a way I'm familiar with -- hopefully that's alright

Are there any aspects of the summary assessment you know you need extra support with?
- rateLimiter middleware is new -- curious to learn how to do this
- eager to practice angular more / getting faster at implementing everything
